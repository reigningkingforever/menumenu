i preached to wale in my dream saying:
if man will try to make it himself, he will lie, steal,kill or destroy
but God with Him, he will excel
God comes to visit Him..
Then God decides to be with Him
Then God now chooses to live in Him
it is that presence of God that he needs to take advantage of
If man will recognize Gods presence and take his help from there, he will excel
God himself knows that this is what man needs
